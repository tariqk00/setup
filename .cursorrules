# Workspace Rules: Setup & Infrastructure (NUC & Chromebook)

## Context
This repository is the definitive "Source of Truth" for infrastructure configuration, deployment scripts, and system documentation.

## Guidelines

### 1. Safety First
- **Chromebook (Dev)**: NEVER enable `systemd` timers or cron jobs here. This is for coding and dry-runs only.
- **NUC (Prod)**: This is strictly for *running* automation, not editing code.

### 2. Deployment Protocol
- **Do Not Edit on NUC**: Avoid changing files directly on the server. Configuration drift is the enemy.
- **Deploy via Script**: ALWAYS use `scripts/deploy_to_nuc.sh` from the Chromebook to push changes.
  - This ensures: `Commit (Dev)` -> `Push (GitHub)` -> `Pull (Prod)` -> `Restart Services`.

### 3. Documentation Authority
- `docs/ENV_SETUP.md` is the **Single Source of Truth** for architecture.
- If you change a system configuration, YOU MUST update `ENV_SETUP.md`.

### 4. Secrets Management
- Zero-trust policy: Never commit `credentials.json`, `.env`, or `token.json`.
- Use `CHROMEBOOK_SECRETS_BACKUP.txt` reference for recovery procedures.
